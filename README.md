Hi, I am Yemaneberhan.

I am interested in Web Development, Natural Language Processing and Linked Data. 

C++ won my heart for programming. But currently working on PHP, JavaScript, and Python.

Mision: Developing and/or involving in an app that makes a positive social impact.

Motto: Give, and it will be given to you.
